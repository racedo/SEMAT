## Summary
Demonstration matches the expectations that we defined in the "design phase" :
- opportunity is addressed
- requirements are addressed and fulfilled
- stakeholders are satisfied for both the deployment and the use of the solution
- the software system is :
  - demonstrable
  - usable
  - ready
  - operational
- the work is now concluded

## Description
With a demonstration of the products to the customer we achieve the following:
the software system: is up and running, where needed connected to the customer environment, and data has been added with which a demonstration can be given.
The stakeholders will be present, and some of them are possbly part of the team that host the meeting.

What can be shown in the demonstration is that all the requirements as taken up in the burndown at the beginning of the project have been met.
Stakeholders present can ask their questions, and provide feedback to make sure all the wishes are met.

Findings are collected, and when all the stakeholders agree we have met all the requirements, the work for the consultants is done.

deliverables: A fully working environment
documentation as to the set-up and maintanance of the environment
